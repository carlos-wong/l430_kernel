config MMC_ARMMMCI

	depends on ARM_AMBA
	help
	  This selects the ARM(R) AMBA(R) PrimeCell Multimedia Card
	  Interface (PL180 and PL181) support.  If you have an ARM(R)
	  platform with a Multimedia Card slot, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_PXA
	tristate "Intel PXA25x/26x/27x Multimedia Card Interface support"
	depends on ARCH_PXA

	  This selects the Intel(R) PXA(R) Multimedia card Interface.

	  say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_SDHCI
	tristate "Secure Digital Host Controller Interface support  (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This select the generic Secure Digital Host Controller Interface.
	  It is used by manufacturers such as Texas Instruments(R), Ricoh(R)
	  and Toshiba(R). Most controllers found in laptops are of this type.
	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_RICOH_MMC
	tristate "Ricoh MMC Controller Disabler  (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && EXPERIMENTAL && MMC_SDHCI
	help
	  This selects the disabler for the Ricoh MMC Controller. This
	  proprietary controller is unnecessary because the SDHCI driver
	  supports MMC cards on the SD controller, but if it is not
	  disabled, it will steal the MMC cards away - rendering them
	  useless. It is safe to select this driver even if you don't
	  have a Ricoh based card reader.


	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called ricoh_mmc.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MMC_OMAP
	tristate "TI OMAP Multimedia Card Interface support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	select TPS65010 if MACH_OMAP_H2
	help
	  This selects the TI OMAP Multimedia card Interface.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_WBSD
	tristate "Winbond W83L51xD SD/MMC Card Interface support"
	depends on ISA_DMA_API
	help
	  This selects the Winbond(R) W83L51xD Secure digital and
          Multimedia card Interface.
	  If you have a machine with a integrated W83L518D or W83L519D
	  SD/MMC card reader, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_AU1X
	tristate "Alchemy AU1XX0 MMC Card Interface support"
	depends on SOC_AU1200
	help
	  This selects the AMD Alchemy(R) Multimedia card interface.
	  If you have a Alchemy platform with a MMC slot, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_AT91
	tristate "AT91 SD/MMC Card Interface support"
	depends on ARCH_AT91
	help
	  This selects the AT91 MCI controller.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_IMX
	tristate "Motorola i.MX Multimedia Card Interface support"
	depends on ARCH_IMX
	help
	  This selects the Motorola i.MX Multimedia card Interface.
	  If you have a i.MX platform with a Multimedia Card slot,
	  say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_TIFM_SD
	tristate "TI Flash Media MMC/SD Interface support  (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PCI
	select TIFM_CORE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to access MMC/SD cards with
	  the Texas Instruments(R) Flash Media card reader, found in many
	  laptops.
	  This option 'selects' (turns on, enables) 'TIFM_CORE', but you
	  probably also need appropriate card reader host adapter, such as
	  'Misc devices: TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter support
	  (TIFM_7XX1)'.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called tifm_sd.

config MMC_SPI
	tristate "MMC/SD over SPI (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on MMC && SPI_MASTER && !HIGHMEM && EXPERIMENTAL
	select CRC7
	select CRC_ITU_T
	help
	  Some systems accss MMC/SD cards using a SPI controller instead of
	  using a "native" MMC/SD controller.  This has a disadvantage of
	  being relatively high overhead, but a compensating advantage of
	  working on many systems without dedicated MMC/SD controllers.

	  If unsure, or if your system has no SPI master driver, say N.
